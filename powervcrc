# Copy this file to your user's home directory and edit as necessary.
# In particular, you may wish to set these values:
#    - OS_USERNAME     : Your PowerVC user name
#    - OS_PASSWORD     : Your PowerVC password. If not set, openstack CLIs
#                        will prompt for the password as needed.
#    - OS_PROJECT_NAME : If you have multiple projects, specify which project
#                        you want to access; else you can leave this as
#                        ibm-default.
#
# NOTE: You should not add your password to this file until/unless its file
# permissions prevent other users from reading it. This is one reason to copy
# the file to your home directory and edit it there. Or you may wish to not
# add your password at all and have the CLI prompt you, as noted above.
